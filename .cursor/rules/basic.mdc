# Code and Design Guidelines

## React and Next.js Components
- For components that use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc), always add `"use client"` at the top of the file.
- Prefer Server Components for components that don't need client interactivity.
- Follow an organized folder structure: pages in `app/`, reusable components in `components/`, custom hooks in `hooks/`, and utilities in `lib/`.
- Use component composition pattern for better reusability.

## UI/UX and Design
- Create elegant, modern, and responsive interfaces - not generic or basic.
- Maintain consistency throughout the UI with uniform spacing, typography, and color palette.
- Apply accessibility principles: adequate contrast, alternative texts for images, and keyboard navigation.
- Use shadcn/ui components for a cohesive and high-quality experience.
- Implement subtle animations to enhance user experience.

## Resources and Libraries
- Use exclusively icons from `lucide-react`.
- For images, use Unsplash with URLs that you know exist.
- Don't install additional libraries for UI, icons, or themes without explicit need.
- Use tailwindcss for styling, following the recommended utility classes.

## Best Practices
- Avoid code that generates the error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style".
- Use TypeScript correctly with proper typing.
- Implement error handling and loading states.
- Optimize performance with memoization (useMemo, useCallback) when appropriate.
- Prioritize SEO with proper metadata on pages.

## Responsiveness
- Develop mobile-first.
- Use Tailwind breakpoint classes (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl) to create responsive layouts.
- Test on multiple screen sizes before finalizing the design.

For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the "use client" directive at the top of the file.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist.
